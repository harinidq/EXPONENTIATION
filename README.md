# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: m.d.harini
#RegisterNumber: 22001980
a=int(input()) 
b=int(input()) 
c=a**b
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",c) 
```
